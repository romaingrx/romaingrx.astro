We authored a paper on Second Order Jailbreak where we delved into the risks posed by malignant intelligent actors spreading their influence over networks of agents with varying intelligence and motivations. 

Key achievements:
- Developed a multi-agent environment for testing jailbreak scenarios ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/romaingrx/second-order-jailbreak))
- Created an interactive [playground website](https://second-order-jailbreak.romaingrx.com) showcasing agent conversations
- Presented research findings at NeurIPS 2023
- Published our [research paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OY5fOWC2_Zf1cCfdAV8PxrL3lwignZi6R_6Mv8vnDoI/export?format=pdf)
